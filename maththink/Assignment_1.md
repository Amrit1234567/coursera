Question 1
=========

Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence `The man saw
the woman with a telescope`, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman
has the telescope.

Answer:
------

1. The man used a telescope to see the woman.
2. The man saw the woman holding a telescope in her hands.

Question 2
=========
For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way
that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:

1. Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway.
2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it.
3. Mayor says bus passengers should be belted.

Answer:
------

1. Sisters reunited in checkout line at Safeway after ten years apart.
2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into fixing it.
3. Mayor says bus passengers should wear seat belts.

Question 3
=========

The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room: `No head injury is too trivial to ignore.`
Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong
that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)

Answer:
------

Do not ignore any head injuries no matter how trivial they may seem.

Question 4
=========

You often see the following notice posted in elevators: `In case of fire, do not use elevator.`
This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended
second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)

Answer:
------

- **First meaning** : The elevator is to be used only in case there is a fire. (Actually this has an even stronger meaning if you replace the comma with a period.)
- **Second meaning**: If the building catches on fire, the use of the elevator is prohibited. 
- **Reformulation**: Do not use the elevator in case there is a fire.

Question 5
=========

Official documents often contain one or more pages that are empty apart from one sentence at the
bottom: `This page intentionally left blank.`
Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement?
What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth? (Once again,
the context means that in practice everyone understands the intended meaning and there is no
problem. But the formulation of a similar sentence in mathematics at the start of the twentieth
century destroyed one prominent mathematician’s seminal work and led to a major revolution in
an entire branch of mathematics.)

Answer:
------

The purpose of such a statement is to make the person that fills the document understand that this one particular page is not to be written at all. But it doesn't make a true statement because the page is no longer blank since it contains that sentence. 
One way for the sentence to be true is to be rephrased like this: `The rest of this page intentionally left blank.`

Question 6
=========

Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is
(clearly) not what the writer intended. (This is much easier than you might think. Ambiguity is
very common.)

Answer:
------

1. 
2. 
3. 

Question 7
=========

Comment on the sentence “The temperature is hot today.” You hear people say things like this
all the time, and everyone understands what is meant. But using language in this sloppy way in
mathematics would be disastrous.

Answer:
------

Temperature is measured by numbers and can be defined with the property of low/high. Apparently what is meant with the above statement is that the temperature is high hence the weather is hot.

Question 8
=========

How would you show that not every number of the form N = (p1 · p2 · p3 · . . . · pn) + 1 is prime,
where p1, p2, p3, . . . , pn , . . . is the list of all prime numbers?

Answer:
------

JUST FOR FUN

Question 1
=========

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the word `and` occurs five times in
succession, with no other word between those five occurrences. (You are allowed to use punctuation.)

Answer:
------



Question 2
=========

Provide a context and a sentence within that context, where the words `and`, `or`, `and`, `or`, `and` occur
in that order, with no other word between them. (Again, you can use punctuation.)

Answer:
------
